# Processor

Welcome to the world of my very own tiny virtual CPU!

This project consists of 3 parts: an assembler, a disassembler and a processor.
Each part has its own executable, but really they are meant to be used together.

## ASSembler
The assembler program reads a text file written in a custom assembly language
and compiles it to a binary that can be then read by the CPU for execution.
